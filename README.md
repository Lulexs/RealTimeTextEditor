# Real-Time Collaborative Rich Text Editor (CRDT)

## Overview

This project is a **Real-Time Collaborative Rich Text Editor** based on **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)**, using the **Y.js library** and the **Y-dotnet** port for synchronization. It allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously while automatically resolving conflicts without requiring complex server-side logic. The project uses **.NET** as the backend, **React** for the frontend, and communicates via **WebSockets**. The backend will store documents in **Cassandra** for persistent storage, with **Redis** for caching, but this part of the project is currently under development.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Users can collaboratively edit code in real-time.
- **CRDTs for Conflict Resolution**: Ensures conflict-free merges of changes from different users using Y.js.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.
- **Frontend in React**: A code editor interface built with React for a responsive and dynamic experience.
- **Backend in .NET**: Handles document synchronization and communication using CRDT-based algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: .NET (ASP.NET Core)
- **CRDT Library**: Y.js, Y-Dotnet
- **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Database (Planned)**: Cassandra (for persistent document storage)
- **Cache (Planned)**: Redis (for caching document state and distributed locks)
